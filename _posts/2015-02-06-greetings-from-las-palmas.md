![Greetings from Las Palmas!](/content/2015-02-06-postcard.jpg)

Hello everyone!

While Las Palmas is getting ready for Carnaval, our learners & coaches are getting ready for a well-deserved break, as they just finished the first half of batch-2. High time to say 'hi' and let you know how things are going!

Over the past 4 weeks our learners have been very busy, learning about Javascript frameworks, compilers, functional languages, Python and I could go on. Really, the range of things learned at Hackership is incredible and just keeps expanding!

And, we don't want to keep all that knowledge to ourselves. We like to share. So, for those interested, we just posted two workshops on youtube. The first, is a video of coach Brian's [workshop on Node.js & Sails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YW4gveA8jtE). The second is a [video of coach Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=d31Jbp-qX4I) explaining how to pick a database.

Enjoy!

Cheers,
the Hackership team
