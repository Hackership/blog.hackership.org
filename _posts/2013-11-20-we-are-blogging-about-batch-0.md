We began intro workshops for Batch-0 this Monday, focusing on learning techniques, how to learn the most effectivley and make the most out of our time here at Hackership Batch-0. One of the suggestions was to keep a good old learning journal. And while some may keep that for themselves, a few have decided to share those with the world and document their learning process and hackership experience on public blogs:

<img src="/content/2013-11-20-sheley.png" style="float:left; margin: 10px;" alt="Picture of Michele"> **Michele** is a former New York State Public School Certified English Language Arts teacher. Since moving to Berlin in 2012, she has discovered a passion for programming and is actively pursuing a career in tech. Through many of the welcoming communities here, including Open Tech School and Berlin Geekettes, she has taken courses and workshops, participated in hackathons, and attended several conferences. She is so grateful for the support she receives in Berlin, furthering opportunities for positive life-changing experiences. Michele is using her time at Hackership to develop a complete web application, from front- to back-end. In addition to programming and all the typical things literature teachers love, she spends her time rock climbing and watching Adventure Time. Her blog can be found at [ihatehandshakes.com](http://www.ihatehandshakes.com)


**Laura** is yet another American in Berlin learning to program. She participated in the inaugural cohort of the Rails Girls Summer of Code, where she built a new web application for aggregating learning resources and wrote her own programming language. Before coming to Berlin in 2012, she worked as a program manager with queer and transgender youth activists in San Francisco. During Hackership, Laura will focus on Javascript and data visualization. In her spare time, you can find Laura riding her bike and speaking passionately about social justice, technology and the intersections of the two.

<img src="/content/2013-11-20-phansch.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 10px;" alt="Picture of Philipp"> **Philipp** has been programming more or less professionally for 8 years. Starting with creating simple websites, moving on to game development in C# and Lua, he is now focusing on web development again with Ruby on Rails. Philipp moved to Berlin two years ago to study computer science but has recently halted progress on a university degree to become a freelance Ruby on Rails developer.

**Carolina** has been part of the spanish free software community for a long time, has founded a women free software cooperative where she has done some web development but mainly consultancy for social and cultural institutions. Her main goal is to give a social approach to technology, to facilitate the access for all to information and knowledge, loves getting involved in social projects related with technology that have to do with digital libraries or  social media.
