On August 15th, the OpenTechSchool Dortmund chapter will host the very first [OTSConf](https://otsconf.com/). As you know, Hackership grew out of the OpenTechSchool movement and is deeply connected to it and its values. No wonder, we were very excited when we learned about the conference and grew only more excited when we learned about the [line-up of talks](https://otsconf.com/#talks) and all the extra efforts the team took to make this conference [as accessible and inclusive as possible](https://otsconf.com/#a11y): from wheel chair access, over the [student and diversity tickets](http://blog.otsconf.com/post/121589262220/how-to-apply-for-community-and-diversity-tickets) to offering child care if needed. And, in good old OpenTechSchool-tradition, the second day is exclusively for workshops.

Amazing, right?

So, you might understand why in all the excitement, we bought a few ticket more than we needed. You simply can't have too many tickets for an event like this. Although, that means someone else can't go. Well, that isn't right either. So, we decided to give these three tickets away in a twitter contest.

Introducing:


### The #OTSFamily competition

Hackership gives away three tickets to [OTSConf 2015](https://otsconf.com/) on August 15th in Dortmund.

To enter the competition, tweet: "*Hey, @hacker_ship. I'm #otsfamily, gimme those @otsconf tickets, plz!*" (or "we are" respectively) **with a picture** of either **what makes you otsfamily, why that family is special to you or just showing you**.

There is no limit on the amount of tweets you send . Also, feel free to add anything else to the tweet to give context or help understand what it is about (you have about 40 chars left).

Here is what an example tweet looks like¹:

> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey, <a href="https://twitter.com/hacker_ship">@hacker_ship</a>. I&#39;m <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/otsfamily?src=hash">#otsfamily</a>, gimme those <a href="https://twitter.com/otsconf">@otsconf</a> tickets, plz!&#10;&#10;&quot;Celebrating Sysadmin-Day by being nice&quot; <a href="http://t.co/8pY9fgWZq3">pic.twitter.com/8pY9fgWZq3</a></p>&mdash; Benjamin Kampmann (@SirDonQui) <a href="https://twitter.com/SirDonQui/status/613713406651166720">June 24, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



#### How the winners are selected:

All tweets with that text and a picture, posted **before July 10th 23:59** (Berlin Time) will take part in the contest. The tickets are awarded as follows:

 - one ticket goes to the tweet, which was **most retweeted**
 - one ticket goes to the tweet with the **most favorites**
 - the third ticket is **raffled among all other participating accounts**

¹ As usual, team members of Hackership and OTSconf are excluded from the raffle. So my tweet there doesn't count ...
