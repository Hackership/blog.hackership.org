Here at Hackership, we're on a quest. A quest to let the world know about self-directed learning; to tell every developer out there that there's a place, a community, where they can go and explore new technologies, be inspired by other developers and get support from friendly coaches.

Five days ago, we (the authors, not the entirety of Hackership) arrived in San Francisco, where we'll be staying for the entire month of April.

And we've hit the ground running. While we've been busy going to meetups, talking about tech and forming new partnerships, we managed to create some great new workshops and meetups that we will be hosting while we're here!

###Hands-on Haskell
Functional programming is gaining momentum. As functional concepts are increasingly common in the most mainstream programming languages, interest in purely functional languages (like Haskell) is increasing. Nonetheless, getting started with a functional language can be a bit of a challenge. The learning curve is steep and without anyone around to help you, it's easy to get stuck.

That's why we're organizing this hands-on workshop for intermediate and experienced developers. Rather than talking about all the theoretical stuff, we'll dive right in and get you to write some actual code!

If that sounds like fun to you, check out our [meetup here](http://www.meetup.com/Hackership/events/221592370/).

###HTTP Under the Hood
Ever wondered what goes on when a browser fetches a website? What these weird request- and response-objects are? And how they can have cookies in their headers? Then this is for you!

In this interactive learning session, we will dissect the HTTP protocol to learn what goes on under the hood. Using simple command line tools and a simple test server, we will discover how browsers communicate with servers. Through this exploration we will discover what headers are, how they work and why some (like Cookies and Agents) are more equal than others and how this influences the outcome of the server.

Find the when and whereâ€™s [here](http://www.meetup.com/Hackership/events/221592437/)!

###Hack, Ship & Tell!
Based on the format of Hack & Tell, we will organise an evening of short demo's. Did you recently write some awesome code that deserves to see the light of day? This is your chance. During 5 minute demo's, developers can showcase their work, giving the rest of us a chance to get inspired!
