We know it's been quite a while since Batch-0 and the OTS fundraiser took place. While we've honestly spent some of that time to recharge, because that's what you do after a huge and successful project, we've come out from this period more committed to Hackership than ever! That being said, we also understand our limits and as such won't be able to keep up with our plan of running the programme again in Q1 of 2014.

We do plan to run it again, though, and soon! And if you're interested, we'd love for you to be involved! We have some ideas on how to make this happen and we'd love to share and discuss them with you. So, if you're interested in helping out with Hackership Batch-1, as an organizer, a volunteer or as a coach, or if you're interested to learn more about the program in general, please come to our first meetup, Tuesday, March 18th, 2014 at Co-Up coworking space (venue subject to change, we will keep you updated).
