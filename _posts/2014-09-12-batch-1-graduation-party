title: "Batch-1 graduates on Sunday (Sept. 28) and you are invited!"
description: "Today is Whit Monday in Germany – a lovely, sunny public Holiday. That also means, it is one day past the Batch-1 application deadline. Still, you will find the application form to be open. Why you ask? Because recent developments allow us to **accept more learners than initially anticipated**! This blog post will give you all the details you need."

We know. You are all curious to find out what went on during the 12 weeks of Hackership. You are anxious to meet our talented developers who just spend their summers becoming even better hackers. 

Good news: the wait is over. Come hang with our learners and celebrate their achievements at the Hackership batch-1 graduation party on ***Sunday September 28, 5pm @ tberlin!*** 

Over the last 12 weeks our learners spend day and night building their projects, while getting familiar with a wide range of technologies. Some focused on data science, while others got busy learning web development with frameworks like Django, Angular.js, or Tornado. And, yet another group of learners discovered the wonderful world of data visualization, using (among others) D3/Javascript. 

On Sunday, they would love to showcase their work over music and cocktails!

So head over to our meetup event and let us know that you’re coming!

[Hope to see you there!] (http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/206610992/4)
