![Announcing Hackership Berlin Summer Batch](/content/2015-03-01-summer-berlin.jpg)

After a winter in Las Palmas, we are returning to our home town this summer, for a Berlin Summer Batch. [Apply Now!](http:www.hackership.org/apply/)

###What to expect
Hackership is a self-directed learning programme. You apply with a learning goal and a project YOU want to work on. We provide guidance, give you feedback and create a safe and productive environment that helps you stay on track and make the most of the 9 weeks you spend with us.

So, in a nutshell: expect to work hard, be both challenged, supported and completely in the driving seat of your own experience! Expect daily standups, weekly demos, code reviews, pair programming, workshops on technical and non-technical developer skills (like setting yourself up as a freelancer and CV consultations for instance), and expect lots of shared lunches and group problem solving. We operate with a maximum coaching ratio of 1 coach to every 5 learners. Often this ratio is actually better - with more coaches per learner.

Ultimately, each Hackershippers’ experience is different. It is what you make of it, depending on your learning focus and the profile you want to build.

###Summer in Berlin
**The batch will run from July 6th until September 3rd, 2015, full time Monday - Thursday for 9 weeks, including one reading week.** In case you’ve been living in a cave and haven’t heard, Berlin is a seriously amazing place. Not just for the low cost of living and huge tech and entrepreneurial scene there, but also for the nature, history, culture, partying and more. Spend your weekdays with us, and your weekends dancing on a beach at an open-air techno party, cycling to and swimming in gorgeous lakes, while eating great and cheap food and meeting a whole host of liberal, crazy creative people. It will make you wonder WTF you are doing living anywhere else.

###Application Process
Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Once you applied, your application will be anonymized, by removing your name and gender. We do this because we do not want anyone to be accepted (or not) based on biases and stereotypes. If you are accepted to Hackership it is because we think you will do great within our programme. That’s it.

Your application will be reviewed by two people who are randomly selected out of a pool of trusted reviewers. Why? Because we want to avoid situations where people try to convince one of our organisers to let them into the programme. Not knowing who will review your application prevents this from happening.

You can read all about our application process [here](http://www.hackership.org/apply/#process-regular).

###Costs & Grants
Applicants to Hackership Batch-2 are eligible for the ‘early bird’ tuition price of 2450 EUR. This money covers the costs of providing a suitable workspace for all learners, getting fantastic coaches to the space to support you, and the running and administration costs of the initiative. Split over 9 weeks, this works out at less than 273 EUR per week.

We also have a grants programme for women, that covers the programme fee.. There are 5 grants available for every intake of 30 students. These Grants will be assigned to eligible applicants on a first-come first-served basis, so [applying](www.hackership.org/apply/) sooner rather than later can have a positive effect on your chances. [Read more about our grants](http://www.hackership.org/apply/#grants)

###Deadline

**The early-bird applications will be closed April 15th, at midnight (Berlin time).. You'll receive an e-mail with follow-up questions within 10 working days of applying and should have a final outcome within 4 weeks.**

If you would like to receive more information or have some burning questions that need answering, please reach out to us at: team@hackership.org. Or, just send us your question using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y4jGzg8JcgvejEO87JkdwmtIRWWnfOEnBP1AelmujNk/viewform). Also check out the (programme information)[http://www.hackership.org/programme/] on our website.

Hope to see you in Berlin this summer!

Cheers,

The Hackership Team

Footnote: if you are uncertain about what you want to learn exactly or are afraid you aren't good enough, we've got two words for you: **Just Apply!** In our follow up conversations, we will figure out a reasonable scope, depending on your experience and goals. It would be sad if we'd miss out on having you in because of a [lack of confidence](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-confidence-gap/359815/). Make sure you apply, so we know you want in and we can help you figure out the rest!
