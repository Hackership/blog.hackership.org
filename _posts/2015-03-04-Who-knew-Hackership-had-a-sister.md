The story goes, once upon a time a cool team of people began thinking long and hard about creating a hacker school.

Who knew Hackership had a sister? Well, sometimes life is full of surprises, isn't it! The story goes, once upon a time a cool team of people began thinking long and hard about creating a hacker school. During the organisational phase, one member of the team started dreaming of a similar yet different program, one with a strong focus on Art & Technology. And then suddenly, just like that, School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe came into being.

[School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe](http://www.schoolofma.org/) is a uniquely curated School born in Berlin, Germany in 2014, keen on inventing one-of-a-kind hands-on learning experiences in the field of Art and Technology. It brings together an ever-changing constellation of talented instructors, themselves distinguished artists, designers, makers and other professionals from around the globe, and provides a space where imaginations can run wild. From the website, "Students come to us ready to expose their creative innards to the world in their own unique ways as they learn to work with new tools and people who can help make it happen." 

Instructors at the School of MA teach tangible skills like how to code, work with electronics and use digital fabrication tools while exploring concepts, narrative and play. The goal is to help people take the fantastical ideas inside their heads out into the physical realm to further their artistic practice or to help wrestle out the confidence to begin one. The School teaches tech skills to artists and design, creativity, and art to the tech community.

### Early Beginnings
The School of MA began in 2014 by running two month-long full-time programs focused on Responsive Spaces and Physical Computing in Berlin.

Currently, in its second year, the School of MA finds itself tackling new themes and technologies.

With an upcoming program in Belgrade, Serbia, taking place from April 20-May 22, 2015, following the city's beloved [Resonate Festival] (http://resonate.io/2015/), a lucky and select group of 10-15 students will find themselves body-swapping, 3D modeling, 3D printing and projection mapping onto frogs, all in the name of empathy and culture in the middle of eastern europe. International applicants, beginners and non-beginners, those looking for a unique and special story to look back on later in life, all are encouraged apply. Last day to submit an application for the Fabricating Empathy program is Sunday, March 8th.

For more specific details on the upcoming program in Belgrade, take a look at the School's [latest newsletter] (http://us8.campaign-archive2.com/?u=8a582affe02962d9e73f8ee6d&id=ac303a3088&e=dc775def3e) which goes a bit more in-depth on the offerings of the course.
