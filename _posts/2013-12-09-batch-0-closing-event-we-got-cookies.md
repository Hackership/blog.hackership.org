It feels like the [experimental Batch-0 Hackership programme at Betahaus Berlin](http://blog.hackership.org/2013/09/announcing-batch-0-supported-by-betahaus.html) just [got started](http://blog.hackership.org/2013/11/we-are-blogging-about-batch-0.html), but it's already time to talk about our closing event. Six weeks go by faster than one would think, and the 19th of December is approaching fast. Our soon to be alumni, the learners of Batch-0, would like to present to the world on this final eve, just what they've been up to – and it's time to get the word out!
