We know. You are all curious to find out what went on during the 12 weeks of Hackership Batch-1. You are anxious to meet our talented developers who just spent the summer becoming even better hackers.

Good news: the wait is over. Hackership Batch-1 graduates! And you are all invited, too. Come hang with our learners and celebrate their achievements at the Hackership batch-1 graduation party on ***Sunday September 28, 5pm @ tberlin!***

Over the last 12 weeks our learners spent day and night building their projects, while getting familiar with a wide range of technologies. Some focused on data science and encryption, others got busy learning web development with frameworks like Django, Angular.js, or Tornado. And, yet another group of learners discovered the wonderful world of data visualization, using (among others) D3.js.

On this Sunday late afternoon, join us for the graduation party during which you can see what our learners have been up to, chat with them, the coaches and organisers or just have a drink in the company of nice people over music.

So head over to [our meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/206610992/) and let us know that youâ€™re coming!

Hope to see you there!
