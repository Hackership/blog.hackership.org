This winter Hackership escapes the Berlin cold. Yes. That's right, batch-2 of Hackership will take place on a warm, sunny beach – Hackership on Tour if you will. And you can [sign up right now](http://www.hackership.org/apply/)!

But, despite all the sun and sand, this is not a vacation. Just like during the other batches of Hackership, you would be working on becoming an even better developer. Together with 20 other learners, you would be working on your own project and setting you own learning goals. It will be hard, it will be frustrating and there will be times when you would love to throw your laptop in the ocean. 

On the other hand, we will provide excellent coaches who will help you refine your goals, figure out how to get unstuck and speed up your overall learning progress. In addition, we pride ourselves on our ability to create a safe learning space where learners help each other get better and, in the process, learn from each other. Oh, and even though this is not a vacation, what butter way to get unstuck then by taking a dive?

**Timeline**
Batch-2 will run for 9 weeks between mid-January and mid-March 2015. 

At this moment the exact location of Hackership batch-2 is still a bit unclear. We are currently looking into South america, Southern Europe and South Asia and would love to get your input too. What we can promise right now are sunshine and beaches. 

**Apply now:**
If you want to be learning in the next Batch - don't delay! [The sooner you apply the better](http://www.hackership.org/apply/). The form will be closed Saturday, October 25th 2014, 23:59 Berlin-time and you'll receive word from us by November 1st.

If you would like to receive more information or have some burning questions that need answered, please reach out to our main organizer Charlotte: charlotte@hackership.org.

Hope to see you in the sun this winter!

Cheers,
The Hackership Team
