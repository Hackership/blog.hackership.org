Listen up, cause we’ve got some pretty exciting news!

After months of hard work and careful preparation we are finally ready to announce the first official batch of Hackership, which will take place from early July till end September. That’s right, a full **12 weeks of hacking and learning**. A special thanks goes out to [Zalando] (http://tech.zalando.com/) who have kindly agreed to host us at their Technology headquarters!

And there’s more: This batch we will focus on **web-based multimedia**, meaning that we will bring in experts in multimedia and organize a bunch of workshops around this topic. 

But, that does not mean we won’t have space for learners focusing on other themes. Just like last time, Hackership batch-1 will provide learners with the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of their chosen fields. We will provide you with coaches, relevant workshops, a daily structure (including standups) and give you access to people specializing in your topic. 

So, our only question to you is: are you ready to start hacking?

If the answer is yes, then here’s your to-do list:
 
1.	**Sign up for Hackership!**  Applications for Hackership batch-1 are open from now until June 8th. Learners can sign up [here] (https://hackership.org/apply/). Or, if you are an experienced programmer and would like to become a coach, please fill out this form [here] (http://bit.ly/1qtxoPf).


2.	Come to our special [Taste of Hackership] (http://blog.hackership.org/2014/05/Announcing-Taste-of-Hackership-Experience-Hackership-first-hand.html) sessions to get an impression of what being a learner or coach at Hackership is all about. The sessions will also give you a chance to ask all your questions.


Of course, if you have any urgent questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us! Our e-mail: team@hackership.org.
