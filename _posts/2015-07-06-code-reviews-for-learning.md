title: "Why Code Reviews Are Great Learning Tools"
description: "Code reviews are a good way to make sure (or at least, somewhat more sure) that crapp or buggy code does not make its way to production. But, code reviews are also a terrific way to consolidate your learning. Here's why!"

###What is a code review?

A code review is the examination of your code and feedback on your code by a peer, or coach. Code reviews can take place online (for instance by using Github), or in person – offline.

###How does a code review work?

Finished a piece of code (or a feature)? Create a patch or pull request and send or assign this to a peer or coach. They will look at your code and make comments, add questions, or give suggestions. 

Alternatively, you could walk someone through your code and explain them what is going on line by line. This is aptly called a code walkthrough.

###Why have a code review?

 1. **Feedback**
In general, code reviews are great ways to get feedback on your code and then use this feedback to improve the code. For instance, you may have made a typo or introduced a bug that you are unaware of, maybe a second pair of eyes will help you catch it. Alternatively, a reviewer can give you feedback on style, or give you tips on how to write the same thing in a more efficient way.

 2. **Knowledge transfer**
Within teams, code reviews can help you share your knowledge of the code base. In a learning environment code reviews are a good way to update your coach on your progress. Or, alternatively, if your code is reviewed by another learner, they will end up learning something new!

 3. **Commit to write better code**
Knowing that your code will see the light of day will make you more likely to think twice before committing something. It could motivate you to take a second look at your code and see if it would hold up under scrutiny. That said, don't let perfectionism get the better of you – there is a balance!
