![Thanks to betahaus for hosting us](/content/2013-09-betahaus.jpg)

We are very happy to share the following news with you: Before we'll be running Hackership next year, **there will be an experimental Batch**, the "Batch-0" [/băch zē'rō/] for six weeks this November. The idea is to use the time to try out concepts and ideas about the programme, see how it works with [hackers in residence](http://www.hackership.org/questions/#faq-hackers-in-residence) and matching groups of people with similar interests. All that made possible through [betahaus](http://betahaus.de/), who will be supporting us by giving us the time to try it out.

We've been planning this for a while and already have many of the OpenTechSchool community on-board to try give the programme this six-weeks trial run but couldn't share this earlier publicly because we didn't have any space yet. Luckily we met with the guys from [betahaus](http://betahaus.de/), who are very interested in what we are doing and immediately offered to host us. An offer we didn't need to think about twice, [betahaus](http://betahaus.de/) has always been a great supporter for bootstrapped community projects in Berlin and they are themselves interested how learning could look like, also in a co-working environment.

With this announcement we are one step closer to setting things up properly. Yes, we are still looking for a bigger space to host more people (we can only accommodate about 20 people within Batch-0) but having the time to figure out, how we want to run things, which things work and which don't, are highly important. So we are incredibly grateful and happy to have such a great supporter like [betahaus](http://betahaus.de/) on-board.
