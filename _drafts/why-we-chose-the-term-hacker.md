There are many names in use for what we do: with coder, programmer and software developer being the most used. So why then, did we chose the most commonly misunderstood term of all? Because no other term captures what we are building quite as "Hacker" does: This is not just some place where you learn to code better, it is about more than that.

### What's a hacker?
Although Eric Steven Raymond wrote his pamphlet ["How to Become A Hacker"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) over a decade ago, the term hacker is still misused and misunderstood by many. Unfortunately not just by mass-media but even supposedly technical-savvy papers like the wired still use images of people [hacking in dark basements](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/01/wiretap-backdoors/) (I recommend reading [the hilarious story behind](http://blog.katylevinson.com/hacker-images/) this picture). But as Ben Balter said so right in his article [What is a 'Hacker'?](http://ben.balter.com/2013/02/16/what-is-a-hacker/) in march (emphasises by us):

 > Being a hacker isn’t about stealing credit card numbers or disabling public utilities, but rather it’s the exact opposite. It’s about embodying all three of those meanings simultaneously. **It’s about sharing, openness, decentralization**… It’s about trying to satisfy an unquenchable thirst for defying expectations and making the impossible a reality, often involving nothing more than duct tape, bubblegum, and ultimately solutions that purported experts would certainly balk at for being too simplistic.

And he goes on describing the way hackers look at the world as being **full of problems to be solved** with the general idea that **no problem should ever have to be solved twice**. Well said.

### Why this matter to us
When thinking of the full time programme we wanted to build based on the [values of OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/about.html) we pretty early on realised that it is as much about the culture as it is about the actual skills. When we talk about openness in OpenTechSchool we think of collaboration instead of competition, when we talk about independent local teams all working together we talk about decentralization, we believe in getting things done and change happen through that. Sounds familiar? **OpenTechSchool itself is build on the ideas and principles of Hacker-ism** (if that word exists). 

So while this is one the one side about empowering the learners to become better by **acquiring technical skills and knowledge**, **Hackership also aims for enlightenment and awareness of the learners**. It is not an employee factory but about making them and society understand that being a hacker is more than just about coding. It is a way to look at the world, a collaborative way, based on openness, sharing and decentralization. And the part we are adding is about a welcoming learning environment and a hands-on approach.
