A vital part of [Hackership](http://www.hackership.org) are the Hackers in Residence, our industry experts, who volunteer their time to help the learners. As the programme is pretty new, so is this role within it, which is why we got often asked "what does a hacker in residence do exactly?". The short answer to this questions is, "they help the learners become better hackers faster". Which is still rather vague. This article is set out to answer that question more specifically.

Hackers in Residence are experienced programming experts – either as generalists or in specific fields. Most have worked in the industry for years. We invited them based on the learning focus and needs of the applicants in the batch. Depending on their schedule, the **Hackers in Residence are with us from a few days to up to two weeks straight at our office space**. Generally they do what everyone does at Hackership, they hack – some even work remotely for their companies – but on top, **they are approachable by the learners at any time** when there is a problem or they need help. Using the daily stand ups in the morning and socializing events around Hackership, we make sure all learners know when and who to talk to about what subject.

That was the general idea, we had in mind when we started the programme. Three weeks into Batch-0 we can report, our **Hackers in Residence are and do so much more than that**. They are pairing up with learners, some full-time, others whenever there is a big problem to tackle, they are giving workshops on specific tools or frameworks of need, run regular question-and-answer sessions on specific subjects and languages and are generally approachable through our online community even when they are not side at the moment. Aside from all that, they share their years of industry experience and insight not only on technologies but also teams and work structures, help with advice and are there to explain even the most complex systems in understandable ways.

To everyone having been to any OpenTechSchool workshop this might feel very familiar. Because it is. Hackership **Hackers in Residence are essentially an extended version of the OpenTechSchool's well-working coaches model applied to learning of advanced topics and technologies**. They are supporters of the programme, coaches and mentors to our learners and do whatever they can to boost the learning extraordinarily. Most of the previously mentioned ideas actually they came up with. We are so grateful to have them.
