By popular demand, we are now offering two, **4 week long learning retreats in Costa Rica**, as well as our regular 9 week Batch! Join us for four consecutive weeks of co-learning, workshops, discussions and [Pura Vida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Costa_Rica#Pura_vida).

Learning happens best when you are happy and motivated. We’re searching for the **perfect blend of education, inspiration, community and relaxation** - and by golly, we think we’ve found it!

Spend your days learning with motivated peers and friendly, experienced coaches, and your free time relaxing, surfing and exploring. Monday to Thursday, the retreat takes place and aims to create the perfect conditions for you to learn and improve your coding. Structures like daily stand up keep you accountable and push you to stick to your plan. But with no boss/client to micro manage your time, or a set training to sit through – you’ll have hours a day to dive deep into learning whatever is most relevant to you. It’s amazing how much you can get done!

Looking directly onto the beach, [our Sky Office creates the conditions](http://localhost:4014/2015/05/Costa-Rica-Sky-Office.html) you need to work well, without shutting out the best things about being in a holiday paradise. The office is covered directly overhead, and surrounded by palm trees for shade, but the external walls are all only waist height. So you can enjoy the ocean breeze and views, whilst coding!  You’ll have your own desk, fast WIFI, friendly coaches, talented peers to learn from and motivate you (and coffee!). But you’ll also look up from your laptop, and see palm trees and the beach, no glass or brick in the way.

###Batch Dates:

- **Part 1**: Monday 14th September - Friday 9th October
- break week
- **Part 2**: Monday 19th October - Friday 13th November

**You can join for Part 1, Part 2 or the entire Batch!**

Got a chapter to read? Do it on the beach! Feeling sleepy post lunch?  Take a quick nap under the palm trees, or jump in the ocean to wake you up!  Hackership is your chance to upgrade your skillset, travel with a purpose, and supercharge your motivation by being in an inspiring place with inspiring peers.

As well as the workspace, **the learning environment is set up to help you be and do your best**. As well as weekly check ins, lightning talks and technical workshops, our onboarding workshops at the start of the retreat help you think about how you learn best, how to get unstuck and what makes a good programmer and self-directed learner. Our **coaches and experienced trainers** will give you support to develop your project plan and learning goals before you arrive, so that you are ready on day one. Once accepted onto the retreat, you’ll also have access to our online platform, for chatting with and sharing resources with the rest of the attendees, coaches and alumni.

And, with Fridays-Sundays off each week, you should also have plenty of time to enjoy the beauty and surf of Santa Theresa and the surrounding national parks and beaches. The best of both worlds!
