A very vital question if you want to run a full-time programme is how this is going to be paid for. Even thought the hackers in residence volunteer their time for free, it still requires a space with facilities and people to take care of it and a staff to run the programme. In this article we want to explain the backgrounds of why we think the alumni-support-model is the right way to go and how you will be able to pay for your hackership without any problem.

### Some Background
But before, just a little bit of background how many of similar programme work. Aside from classic tuitions, a lot of programmes also work as recruiter for tech companies, helping learners find a job at one of their partnering companies and receive a hire-fee, a percentage of the first year salary for every signature. Scarcity is strong enough that companies are willingly paying those fees, 20-25% being usual but we've also heard of up to 30% for good candidates. And that isn't even for educational programmes but for any random IT-recruiter.

What then happens in HR departments of those companies is that they have a target budget for their hire they can't overstep. Meaning they are calculating having to pay the recruiter fee on top when negotiating the salary. Though they can potentially go higher than what was assigned before but that requires special authorization and a lot of questions. So what this means in reality is that this recruiting fee is taken out of what you can negotiate but would be available if there was no recruiting fee to pay. So, yes, if you don't go through a recruiter you can easily ask for 25% more than you would just because it is still in their budget. This is just how recruiting works today.


### Why we choose a different model

----

Now, 25% of an tech first year salary, that isn't too shabby. So it is totally understandable why this is a model of choice for many. But this comes with a few strings attached. It only works if you get hired by one of the partner companies, meaning companies the recruiter has a before signed contract with. And aside from that meaning a lot of paper work and organisational overhead, this naturally limits the selection of companies you are interested for the learner to get hired - very often also to a certain physical location. But what if the perfect fit for that person is a different company? Maybe even in a differnt country? 

Another nasty side-effect is that the people you are paying you are the people you are activly working with, the learners, you put so much time into helping to get better. No the ones paying for the programme are companies. And companies always have their agenda. Which is fine, but also why they shouldn't be tight too much into educational facilities and programmes. It just requires one year where money gets a little more tight and one of the big spending companies mentions they are more insterested in having more X-coders. And without you wanting it, They and You are influencing the programme. The focus in this system simply isn't with the leaners.


### The alumni support model
----

That is very different if the person paying for the programme is also the person learning. This is the person you are serving and what they want to learn is your number one priority, no matter what any other company says. But a tuition has a bitter taste to it, too, usually: if you make people before hand they might get out of the programme with a big dept (a classic problem in the european designer market). Also, what price-tag would you put on an environment that helps you learn by yourself but doesn't issue any certificates itself?

With the alumni support model you only pay after the programme is over and only if you found a suiting job in the field. We know other fields don't pay as much, but if you'd rather go there, that is okay with us: We will not be the one holding dept over you to take a well-paid job you don't like. At the same time, if you were accepted because we believed that you love this field and that you can get much better with a hackership and ask for a much higher price after than what the alumni-support is asking you to contribute back. That way it is also very much in our interest that every learner coming out of the programme knows their market value and is able to negotiate a decent and fair salary.


### How you can easily pay it
----

#### supporting companies
And though we aren't a recruiter, we have our contacts and know people and companies that hire. They are talking to us every day because they are looking for people like those we are accepting in our programme. And they told first hand, that we could and should ask for a higher fee. Which we don't want to. Because our contract is with you and not with them. But if your concern is not finding a company that does understand is willing to pay you the surplus to pay for the programme instead of a paying the fee to a random recruiter, let us know.

#### your employer
Aside from that, the alumni support model offers quite more benefits. For example we don't require that you are unemployed during or after the programme to be able to get you hired. You can work for any company (just not while being at the programme itself), which might also means your current employer. We heard of chefs openly discussing a model where the learner would get a reduced payment during the programme and working the fifth day to pay for the programme without having no income (in that particular case, the employer even covered half of the fee themselves). And we can even send out the bill to your employer (as they can write off taxes).

#### freelance work
And as the alumni fee is based on your monthly income after taxes this model also works if you want to (continue to) work as freelancer after the programme ended. We know how hard this can be, clients that don't pay on time - we've been there, too. And we don't want to be another burden on top of that, which is why a monthly-income-based payment model is perfect: no income that month, nothing to pay. You just pay more the next month, when they follow up paying their bills. And similar as for employers, you can also put these bills against your yearly taxes.
