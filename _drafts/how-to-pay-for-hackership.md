A vital question for running a full-time programme is how this is going to be paid for. Even thought the hackers in residence volunteer their time for free, one still needs to pay for a venue with facilitiee, people to take care of it and a staff to run the programme. Today, we want to explain the backgrounds of why we think the alumni-support-model is the best way to do this and how you will be able to pay for your hackership without any problem.

### Some Background
Tech people are so scarce that companies are willing to pay recruiters hire-fees of 20-25% but we've also heard of up to 30% for good candidates. So it makes sense for an educational programme to dip into the market. As a result some programme are not run through classic tuition, but have a part or even all of it paid through this recruiting fee. But the HR departments still have a target budget to hire people with, so what they do internally is they cut off this fee - if they have to pay - of the negotiable salary. Meaning if 25% of your salary go to the recruiters this is money you never had chance to negotiate in the first place - though the company is willing to pay you that. But this is just how recruiting works today.


### Why we choose a different model

----

25% of the first year salary of a tech person, that isn't too bad. But this comes with a few strings attached. It only works if you get hired by one of the partner companies, meaning companies the recruiter and educators have a beforehand signed contract with. Aside from resulting in paper work and organisational overhead, this naturally limits the selection of companies one is interested for the learner to get hired with - very often also to a certain physical location. But what if the perfect fit for that person is a different company? Maybe even in a different country? 

Another nasty side-effect is those, who eventually pay the bills aren't the learners, you are actively working with, helping to get better. The ones paying are companies, and companies always have their agenda. And though this might be fine today, it just requires one year where money gets a little more tight and one of the big spending companies mentions they are more interested in having more X-coders instead of Y and without you even consciously being aware of it, you start are influencing the programme. Because your ultimate focus in this system simply isn't with the learners themselves.


### The alumni support model
----

That is fundamentally very in the case where the learner pays for the education: they and what they want to learn are the number one priority. Unfortunately a tuition has a bitter taste to it, too, usually: if you make people pay before hand they might get out of the programme with a big debt and it sets the wrong incentive for the education because they believe their job is done once the learner finished the programme. 

Other in the *alumni support model*, where the learner only pays after the programme is over and only if they found a suiting job in the field and only an amount they can afford - a fixed percentage of the monthly income after taxes. Aside from being the most learner friendly model, this also means the focus of Hackership is to help the learner to get so much better that their market price increases even more than what the Hackership costs. And with the learner being the ultimate "customer" of the programme, it is also in the interest of Hackership to enable them to negotiate for that salary they deserve.


### How you can easily pay it
----

We believe this is best model to run Hackership by. And we also believe that those, who are accepted to the programme, paying for their Hackership afterwards isn't as hard as it sounds. Here are a few examples, how...

#### supporting companies
Being tech people ourselves, we are strongly connected in the community, know many people and companies and what they are looking for to hire and they are highly interested in people like those we are accepting into Hackership. They told first hand, that we could and should ask for a higher fee, they would willingly pay it. Which we don't want to as the contract is with the learner and not with them. But also getting to know the learner over the period of the programme, if they are concerned finding a company that gives them a salary to afford to pay for HS, we know of plenty that do and we'll help find a good position if needed.

#### your employer
But the alumni support model offers other models, too: For example we don't require that you are unemployed during or after the programme just to be able to get you hired for partnering companies. You can work for any company (just not while being on side at the programme), which might also means your current employer. We heard of supervisors openly discussing a model where the learner would get a reduced payment during the programme while working the fifth day and the company would cover the the costs of the programme. And you won't believe how many supervisors would love to hear their employees coming up with such an offer to them - because continuous training for employees is a big problem they usually have to pay much more for. And though the contract is with the learner, the programme also offers that the bill might send to a to your employer (as they can write off taxes).

#### freelance work
Another case that is tricky with classic models is for freelancers. They often don't accept them as they won't get hired but go back to freelancing. But the alumni support model fee is based on the learners monthly income after taxes, so this programme is totally fine and happy to accept freelancers. And with percentage being a relative value, this is also a very fluid model and doesn't require you pay back a fixed amount in the month in which the client is late on their payment: no income that month, nothing to pay. You just pay more the next month, when they follow up paying their bills. And similar as for employers, you can also put these bills against your taxes at the end of the year, saving you even more money.

### Conclusion
The alumni support model is the most flexible and for a community run system most appropriate of all possible models to run this programme. With the scarcity in computer programmers being so high we aren't concerned at all that any learner will ever have problems paying for it. But if there is any concern, we are able to help with that, too.
